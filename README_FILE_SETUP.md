# File Setup Instructions

## File Input Field Navigation

Due to browser security restrictions, the extension cannot automatically select files. Instead, it provides a convenient way to navigate to the file input field.

### Features:

1. **Scroll to File Input**: Press the configured hotkey (default: 8) to scroll to the file input field
2. **Visual Highlight**: The field will be highlighted with a blue border for 3 seconds
3. **Focus**: The field will be automatically focused for easy access
4. **Manual Selection**: You can then manually select the KHIDMATMARKAZ.jpeg file

### Usage:

- **Hotkey**: Press the configured key (default: 8) to scroll to file input field
- **Button**: Click the "Scroll to File Input" button in the extension
- **Result**: The page will scroll to the file input field and highlight it

### Benefits:

- **Quick Navigation**: Instantly scrolls to the file input field
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear highlighting shows which field to use
- **Focus Ready**: Field is automatically focused for immediate file selection
- **Browser Compatible**: Works within browser security restrictions

### No File Setup Required:

Unlike the previous version, no KHIDMATMARKAZ.jpeg file needs to be added to the extension folder. The feature simply helps you navigate to the file input field quickly.
